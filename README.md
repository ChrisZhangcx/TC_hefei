Concretely, it's a product to attend [Tianchi ECG competition](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231754/introduction?spm=5176.12281949.1003.1.7a0b2448BvJ1Fi).

This competition aims to label ECGs to diagnose diseases, which is generally researched by multiple organizations.

I coded about *3 days* to create the whole structure but with trouble making network really work. So maybe it's time to stop (since I still
have many important work to do in hand).

The main problems I encountered involves:

1. Multi-label question
2. Class imbalance
3. **Lack of time**

So I think maybe all the work I did these days may encourage me to attend other competitions in future (hopefully).

`However, it is still a pretty good pratice :)`
